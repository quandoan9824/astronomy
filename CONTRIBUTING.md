# contributing

hey! thanks for your interest in contributing.

if you want something small to work on, search the repository for "TODO" or "FIXME" and tackle one that suits your fancy.

feel free to also check out the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/yhvr/galaxy-astro/-/issues).

if you can't figure out what you want to add, join [the discord](https://galaxy.click/discord) and chat with us in `#galaxy-dev`.

[here's a tip](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically): in a merge request, if its description or a commit includes "closes #\<issue\>", that issue will automatically be closed when the MR is merged.

that's about it, i think. again, thanks for your interest.

...

oh, uh, code style? just use tabs, i guess.

use `pnpm run format` to make sure you got it right.
