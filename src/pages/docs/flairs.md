# flairs âœ¨

Flairs are a simple way of showing someone's status on Galaxy. You can have one flair equipped at a time.

The current flairs (and their requirements) are:

- **`none`**  
  The default "flair", in which no flair appears.

- **`gamedev`**  
  Users that posted at least one game of theirs on Galaxy. This flair is not granted automatically, but that is the only requirement.

- **`tester`**  
  Users that helped test Galaxy in its infancy.

- **`contributor`**  
  Users that made significant non-monetary contributions (e.g. code) to Galaxy.

- **`donator`**  
  Users that financially supported Galaxy on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Yhvr).

- **`mod`**  
  A moderator of Galaxy.

- **`admin`**  
  An administrator of Galaxy.

- **`owner`**  
  The owner of Galaxy. There are only 2 users with this flair: [yhvr](/user/1), the founder of Galaxy, and [Galaxy](/user/-1) itself.
